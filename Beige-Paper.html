The Beige-Paper - v1.0
Title: BeigeCoin: A Return to Basics
Author: The BeigeCoin Core Developers
Date: June 2025
Status: This document is a living specification and manifesto for the BeigeCoin project.

1. Abstract: The Philosophy of Beige
Cryptocurrency began with a simple, powerful idea: a decentralized, peer-to-peer system for everyone. Over time, this vision has become clouded by hype, speculation, and an arms race of specialized hardware that has priced out the everyday user. The hobbyist, the tinkerer, the person running a node from their home computer, has been left behind.
BeigeCoin is the antidote.
It is a deliberate step backwards into the past to find a better future. It is built on the belief that a network's strength comes from its decentralization, not its hashrate. It is a tribute to the humble, reliable beige box—underestimated in its appearance, but revolutionary in its purpose.
Our mission is to create a CPU-mineable cryptocurrency that is 100% fair, community-driven, and accessible to anyone with a computer.

2. Core Principles
Humble Hardware, Honest Hash: Our guiding principle. We believe that securing a network should be an act of participation, not a war of capital. We are committed to an algorithm that levels the playing field, making high-end, specialized hardware impractical.
100% Fair Launch: BeigeCoin will have no pre-mine, no ICO, no developer tax, and no venture capital allocation. The developers are participants who will be mining from Block 1, on equal footing with every other member of the community.
Simplicity and Stability: Our goal is not to chase trends. We are forking from a robust, time-tested codebase (Monero) to provide a stable and secure foundation. The "innovation" is not in complex features, but in our radical commitment to fairness and accessibility.
Community Ownership: BeigeCoin is and always will be an open-source, community project. All development, tools, and resources will be public. The future of BeigeCoin will be decided by those who build and participate in it.

4. The "Roadmap" (The Build-Out)
We believe in building useful things, not hype. Our roadmap is simple and focused on creating a healthy ecosystem.
Phase 1: Genesis (Q3 2025)
✅ Launch of the BeigeCoin Mainnet.
✅ Release of core node daemon (beigecoind) and CLI wallet.
✅ Public launch of the official mining pool.
✅ Launch of the public network Block Explorer.
Phase 2: Infrastructure (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)
Development and release of a user-friendly GUI Desktop Wallet.
Creation of a "1-Click Miner" application for Windows to lower the barrier to entry.
Work with the community to establish more mining pools and seed nodes.
Phase 3: Adoption (2026 and Beyond)
Focus on community-led initiatives.
Pursue listings on small, community-focused exchanges.
Develop fun, proof-of-concept use cases, like a service that accepts $BEIGE to post a message on a retro-styled digital bulletin board.

5. Disclaimer
BeigeCoin is a highly experimental, community-driven project. It is provided "as-is" without any warranty. The $BEIGE coin is a utility token for participating in this experimental network. It is not an investment, and it has no inherent monetary value. Do not risk any funds you are not prepared to lose entirely.
This is a hobbyist project. Participate, build, learn, and have fun.
In Humble Hardware We Trust.
