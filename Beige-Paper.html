    <h1>The Beige-Paper v1.0</h1>

    <h2>1. Abstract: The Philosophy of Beige</h2>
    <p>
        Cryptocurrency began with a simple, powerful idea: a decentralized, peer-to-peer system for everyone. Over time, this vision has become clouded by hype, speculation, and an arms race of specialized hardware that has priced out the everyday user. The hobbyist, the tinkerer, the person running a node from their home computer, has been left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
        BeigeCoin is the antidote.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a deliberate step backwards into the past to find a better future. It is built on the belief that a network's strength comes from its decentralization, not its hashrate. It is a tribute to the humble, reliable beige boxâ€”underestimated in its appearance, but revolutionary in its purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our mission is to create a CPU-mineable cryptocurrency that is 100% fair, community-driven, and accessible to anyone with a computer.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Core Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Humble Hardware, Honest Hash:</strong> Our guiding principle. We believe that securing a network should be an act of participation, not a war of capital. We are committed to an algorithm that levels the playing field, making high-end, specialized hardware impractical.</li>
        <li><strong>100% Fair Launch:</strong> BeigeCoin will have no pre-mine, no ICO, no developer tax, and no venture capital allocation. The developers are participants who will be mining from Block 1, on equal footing with every other member of the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity and Stability:</strong> Our goal is not to chase trends. We are forking from a robust, time-tested codebase (Monero) to provide a stable and secure foundation. The "innovation" is not in complex features, but in our radical commitment to fairness and accessibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Community Ownership:</strong> BeigeCoin is and always will be an open-source, community project. All development, tools, and resources will be public. The future of BeigeCoin will be decided by those who build and participate in it.</li>
    </ul>
